Make system/language for importing, exporting, manipulating and analyzing "sheet music"

Idea: Compare to LLVM IR, and other sheet music software like lilypond.

Some goals:
Read music from different formats, mainly lilypond and midi files?

Export to various formats? Low priority.

Playback? Could be nice, but sounds like a lot of work.

Have own format for keeping info? Better to stick with some variant of lilypond...

A song consists of different voices, which

Use cases:
from a specific measure beat, give info on chord / notes
 From beat, get measure. From measure, get voices / notes at that point.
 Format? M3B3? getStuff(base.Measure m, Beat b)
 How to deal with offbeat?

from part of song, get details on note progressions, chord progressions, more info?
 highest / lowest notes (range)
 metadata ?
 other fun vectors

from collection of



From midi file, get help turning it to a nice formatted sheet? (This is probably already part of midi2ly? http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.19/Documentation/usage/invoking-midi2ly)
This might be a better case for musesecore ...

Progression:
Split up import into separate interface
Same with import

Lily:
 Model (import) one monophonic song - a single voice, simple.
 polyphonic song with all voices all the time
 polyphonic song with sporadic voices that come and go. (look at voice name? Have a new voice each time? )


Idea:
Analysis pass like lucene or LLVM
